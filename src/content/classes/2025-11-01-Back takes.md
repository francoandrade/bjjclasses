In the 80s, by master Ricardo Delariva, from Rio, used to control the distance and avoid being smashed by bigger oponnents.
- It starts griping his foot, in two ways: grabbing the heel, or grabbing the pants (explain difference)
- You put a hook later. My hooked leg I have to push to the right, with the knees closed. If it is opened, it is easy for him to push my knee down and break the hook. My hips should be close to his foot.
- Right leg should be active, it creates distance, or pull him to me.
- Right hand can go in different places, I'll put in the the collar. Important to have connections
