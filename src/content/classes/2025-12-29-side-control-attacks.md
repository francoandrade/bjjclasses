- Hips on top of his foot (otherwise he will escape)
- Keep right leg hook otherwise he can pass my guard
- My right leg hook should be behind the knees. If it is on the heel, he can easily takes out, although I have more leverage.
- Do not hold the collar, hold the cross sleeve (his right sleeve)
- Take out my left leg when he drops, and do levantada tecnica. After the sweep, hold both legs and then levantada tecnica
- Control the bottom leg when he drops, otherwise he will come to the top.
- If his left leg is very far for me to reach, I should not extend a lot cause I am weak like that. Instead, I should reverse tripod sweep

**5 DETALHES DA BOTINHA:**

a. Nao abrace com todo o braco, pois tem muito musculo. Apenas a metade do braco.

b. Segura a gola oposta, to be tight. Use the other hand to feed

c. Thumbs up, to use the sharp part of the forearms.

d. Close the elbows

e. Make the grips strong
